## Overview
This document details the current state of security vulnerabilities in the Rust AI IDE project as of September 16, 2025.

## Status Summary
- **Total Active Vulnerabilities**: 1
- **Resolved Vulnerabilities**: 1 (RUSTSEC-2024-0437 - protobuf vulnerability)
- **Resolution Rate**: 50% (1 out of 2 active vulnerabilities resolved)

## Resolved Vulnerabilities

### âœ… RUSTSEC-2024-0437 (RESOLVED)
**Title**: Crash due to uncontrolled recursion in protobuf crate
**Severity**: High
**Affected Versions**: protobuf < 3.7.2

**Resolution Details:**
- **Fix Applied**: Updated prometheus from 0.13.4 to 0.14.0 across all crates
- **Root Cause**: prometheus 0.13.4 used protobuf 2.28.0 which contained the vulnerability
- **Impact**: protobuf 0.14.0 uses protobuf 3.7.2 which fixes the uncontrolled recursion issue
- **Verification**: Confirmed via `cargo audit` - vulnerability no longer appears in audit results
- **Affected Crates Updated**:
  - rust-ai-ide-lsp
  - rust-ai-ide-ai-distributed-coordinator
  - rust-ai-ide-ai-orchestration-core
  - rust-ai-ide-predictive-completion
  - rust-ai-ide-predictive-quality

## Remaining Vulnerabilities

### ðŸš¨ RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (ACTIVE - NO FIX AVAILABLE)
**Title**: Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannels
**Severity**: Medium (5.9/10)
**Affected Package**: rsa v0.10.0-rc.8 (release candidate)
**Advisory URL**: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0071

**Vulnerability Description:**
The RSA crate version 0.10.0-rc.8 contains known timing sidechannel vulnerabilities that could potentially allow attackers to recover private keys through timing analysis attacks. This is a classic "Marvin Attack" where variations in execution time during cryptographic operations can leak information about the private key.

**Current Status:**
- **Latest Available**: rsa v0.10.0-rc.8 (release candidate only)
- **No Stable Release**: No stable version available that fixes this issue
- **Affected Crates**:
  - rust-ai-ide-security
  - rust-ai-ide-compliance
- **Dependency Chain**: Used directly for RSA cryptographic operations

**Impact Assessment:**

**High Risk Scenarios:**
- Systems performing RSA decryption/verification operations frequently
- Systems handling sensitive data decryption
- Public-facing cryptographic services

**Medium Risk Scenarios:**
- Internal cryptographic operations with limited exposure
- Systems where timing attacks are difficult to execute
- Development/testing environments

**Mitigation Strategies:**

### 1. Operational Mitigations
```rust
// Example of constant-time operations (if available)
use std::time::Instant;

// Always perform operations in constant time
let start = Instant::now();
// ... cryptographic operations ...
let elapsed = start.elapsed();
// Log timing anomalies for monitoring
if elapsed.as_micros() > EXPECTED_MAX_MICROS {
    log::warn!("Cryptographic operation took longer than expected: {:?}", elapsed);
}
```

### 2. Architecture-Level Mitigations
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on cryptographic operations
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of RSA inputs to prevent malformed data
- **Error Handling**: Ensure consistent error responses that don't leak timing information

### 3. Key Management Practices
- **Key Rotation**: Implement regular key rotation policies
- **Key Strength**: Use sufficiently large RSA key sizes (4096-bit minimum)
- **HSM Integration**: Consider moving to Hardware Security Modules for production

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting
```rust
// Implement timing anomaly detection
pub struct CryptoTimingMonitor {
    normal_ranges: std::collections::HashMap<&'static str, std::ops::Range<u128>>,
}

impl CryptoTimingMonitor {
    pub fn check_operation(&self, operation: &str, duration_micros: u128) -> bool {
        if let Some(normal_range) = self.normal_ranges.get(operation) {
            if !normal_range.contains(&duration_micros) {
                log::error!("Timing anomaly detected in {}: {}Î¼s", operation, duration_micros);
                // Alert security team
                return false;
            }
        }
        true
    }
}
```

### 5. Alternative Cryptographic Approaches
Consider migrating to:
- **Ed25519**: For digital signatures (faster, more secure than RSA)
- **ECDSA**: For elliptic curve digital signatures
- **AES-GCM**: For symmetric encryption where RSA isn't strictly required

### 6. Development Practices
- **Code Review**: Mandatory security review for all cryptographic code
- **Testing**: Implement timing attack resistance tests
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of security considerations

**Monitoring Plan:**
1. **Daily Audits**: Run `cargo audit` daily and alert on new vulnerabilities
2. **RSA Usage Tracking**: Monitor all RSA operations with timing metrics
3. **Version Monitoring**: Subscribe to RSA crate releases for stable version availability
4. **Security Scanning**: Regular third-party security scans
5. **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for cryptographic vulnerabilities

**Timeline for Resolution:**
- **Immediate**: Implement operational mitigations and monitoring
- **Short-term (1-3 months)**: Plan migration path away from RSA where possible
- **Long-term (3-6 months)**: Upgrade to stable RSA version when available
- **Fallback**: Consider forking or patching RSA crate if stable version remains unavailable

## Security Policies
- **License Compliance**: Only MIT/Apache-2.0 licenses allowed
- **Registry Restrictions**: Only crates.io registry permitted
- **Banned Crates**: openssl, md5, ring, quick-js (security reasons)
- **Exception**: Git2 allowed despite GPL due to operational necessity

## Recommendations
1. **Implement RSA Mitigations**: Apply all recommended operational and architectural mitigations
2. **Monitor RSA Usage**: Track RSA operations with timing analysis
3. **Plan Migration**: Evaluate alternatives to RSA where feasible
4. **Security Training**: Ensure team awareness of timing attack vectors
5. **Incident Response**: Document procedures for cryptographic vulnerabilities

## Verification Steps
1. Run `cargo audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities
2. Monitor RSA crate releases for stable version availability
3. Test all mitigations in staging environment before production
4. Perform security assessment of alternative cryptographic approaches
