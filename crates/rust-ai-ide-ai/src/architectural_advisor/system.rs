//! # Core Architectural Advisor System Implementation
//!
//! This module implements the intelligent architectural advisor that combines multiple
//! AI/ML algorithms to provide comprehensive software architecture analysis and
//! recommendations. The system integrates pattern recognition, quality assessment,
//! and decision support capabilities.
//!
//! ## Architecture Analysis Pipeline
//!
//! The advisor follows a sophisticated multi-stage analysis pipeline:
//!
//! 1. **Context Validation**: Ensures architectural context is complete and valid
//! 2. **Codebase Analysis**: Deep structural analysis of code organization and dependencies
//! 3. **Pattern Recognition**: ML-enhanced detection of architectural patterns and anti-patterns
//! 4. **Quality Assessment**: Multi-dimensional quality metrics calculation
//! 5. **Complexity Evaluation**: Cyclomatic, cognitive, and coupling complexity analysis
//! 6. **Recommendation Generation**: AI-powered synthesis of actionable guidance
//! 7. **Risk Assessment**: Probabilistic risk evaluation with mitigation strategies
//!
//! ## AI/ML Integration Points
//!
//! The system integrates several AI/ML capabilities:
//!
//! - **Pattern Detection**: Uses machine learning models to identify architectural patterns
//!   with confidence scoring rather than binary classification
//! - **Quality Prediction**: Combines traditional metrics with predictive analytics
//!   for technical debt and maintainability forecasting
//! - **Decision Support**: Provides evidence-based architectural recommendations
//!   with quantified impact and effort assessments
//! - **Risk Modeling**: Uses probabilistic methods to assess implementation risks
//!
//! ## System Architecture
//!
//! The advisor is composed of specialized components:
//!
//! - [`PatternDetector`]: Handles pattern recognition and anti-pattern identification
//! - [`MetricsAnalyzer`]: Calculates quality and complexity metrics
//! - [`DecisionEngine`]: Provides algorithmic decision support
//! - [`RecommendationGenerator`]: Synthesizes actionable recommendations
//! - [`ArchitecturalValidator`]: Ensures analysis quality and context validity
//!
//! ## Pipeline Performance Characteristics
//!
//! The analysis pipeline is designed for both speed and accuracy:
//!
//! - **Incremental Analysis**: Supports partial re-analysis for efficiency
//! - **Parallel Processing**: Uses async processing for concurrent component analysis
//! - **Caching Strategy**: Implements intelligent caching of expensive computations
//! - **Adaptive Sampling**: Adjusts analysis depth based on project size and complexity
//!
//! ```rust
//! use rust_ai_ide_ai::architectural_advisor::*;
//!
//! // Full analysis pipeline example
//! async fn comprehensive_analysis() {
//!     let advisor = create_architectural_advisor();
//!
//!     let context = ArchitecturalContext {
//!         codebase_path: "/path/to/project".to_string(),
//!         project_type: ProjectType::WebService,
//!         constraints: vec!["performance".to_string(), "scalability".to_string()],
//!         goals: vec!["maintainability".to_string(), "security".to_string()],
//!         team_size: Some(8),
//!         ..Default::default()
//!     };
//!
//!     println!("Starting multi-stage analysis...");
//!
//!     // Phase 1: Pattern analysis (ML-enhanced)
//!     let analysis = advisor.analyze_patterns(context).await?;
//!     println!("✓ Pattern recognition complete");
//!
//!     // Phase 2: Recommendation synthesis (Decision engine)
//!     let guidance = advisor.get_recommendations(&analysis).await?;
//!     println!("✓ AI-powered recommendations generated");
//!
//!     // Phase 3: Risk assessment (Probabilistic modeling)
//!     println!("Overall risk: {:.2}", guidance.risk_assessment.overall_risk);
//!
//!     println!("Architectural analysis complete");
//!     # Ok(())
//! }
//! ```

    /// # Analysis Algorithm Overview
    ///
    /// The analysis employs a multi-phase, parallel processing approach:
    ///
    /// ## Phase 1: Context Validation
    /// - Validates architectural context completeness and consistency
    /// - Ensures required project information is available for accurate analysis
    /// - Logs issues but continues processing (graceful degradation)
    ///
    /// ## Phase 2: Codebase Structural Analysis
    /// - Parses code structure, modules, and dependencies
    /// - Extracts semantic information about code organization
    /// - Identifies key architectural boundaries and interfaces
    ///
    /// ## Phase 3: ML-Powered Pattern Recognition
    /// - **Machine Learning Core**: Uses trained models to identify meaningful patterns
    /// - **Similarity Matching**: compares code structure against known architectural patterns
    /// - **Context Integration**: factors in project type, technology, and domain knowledge
    /// - **Confidence Scoring**: provides probabilistic confidence (0.0-1.0) for each detection
    ///
    /// ## Phase 4: Anti-Pattern Detection
    /// - Identifies architectural smells and problematic patterns
    /// - Uses both rule-based and ML-enhanced detection methods
    /// - Provides severity scoring and refactoring recommendations
    ///
    /// ## Phase 5: Quality Metrics Calculation
    /// - Computes maintainability index, complexity measures, and quality indicators
    /// - Integrates test coverage and code health metrics
    /// - Provides normalized scoring for cross-project comparison
    ///
    /// ## Phase 6: Complexity Assessment
    /// - Analyzes cognitive complexity and code understandability
    /// - Identifies complexity hotspots requiring attention
    /// - Tracks complexity trends over time periods
    ///
    /// ## Phase 7: Relationship Analysis (Coupling/Cohesion)
    /// - Calculates module coupling and cohesion metrics
    /// - Analyzes dependency patterns and instability factors
    /// - Provides detailed inter-module relationship insights
    ///
    /// # Parallel Processing Strategy
    ///
    /// For optimal performance, the analysis pipeline prioritizes computationally expensive operations:
    /// - Pattern detection algorithms run concurrently with quality assessment
    /// - Dependency analysis and coupling calculations are parallelized
    /// - Results are synthesized in a final aggregation phase
    ///
    /// # Error Handling Strategy
    ///
    /// Implements fault-tolerant processing:
    /// - Individual component failures don't halt entire pipeline
    /// - Partial results are still useful and accumulated
    /// - Validation issues are logged but don't prevent completion
    ///

    /// - Lazy evaluation of computationally expensive metrics
    /// - Adaptive analysis depth based on project size
