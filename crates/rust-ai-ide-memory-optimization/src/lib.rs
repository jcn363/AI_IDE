//! # Advanced Memory Optimization and Leak Detection System
//!
//! This crate provides comprehensive memory optimization capabilities for the Rust AI IDE,
//! including advanced leak detection, garbage collection tuning, automatic optimization suggestions,
//! and real-time memory monitoring with SIMD acceleration and AI-powered analysis.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Memory Leak Detection**: Real-time identification of memory leaks and circular references
//! - **Garbage Collection Tuning**: Intelligent GC optimization for optimal memory management
//! - **Automatic Optimization Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations for memory improvements
//! - **Real-time Memory Monitoring**: Live memory usage tracking and alerting
//! - **SIMD Acceleration**: Vectorized operations for high-performance memory analysis
//! - **Cross-Crate Analysis**: Memory leak detection spanning multiple workspace crates
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The system integrates with existing performance infrastructure including:
//! - SIMD acceleration from `rust-ai-ide-simd`
//! - Performance monitoring from `rust-ai-ide-perfdevel-tools`
//! - AI analysis from `rust-ai-ide-ai-codegen`
//! - Caching infrastructure from `rust-ai-ide-cache`
