# When uploading crates to the registry Cargo will automatically

#
# If you are reading this file be aware that the original Cargo.toml
# will likely look very different (and much more reasonable).
# See Cargo.toml.orig for the original contents.

Provides functions to read and write safetensors which aim to be safer than
their PyTorch counterpart.
The format is 8 bytes which is an unsized int, being the size of a JSON header,
the JSON header refers the `dtype` the `shape` and `data_offsets` which are the offsets
