## Architecture Overview

### Modular Workspace Structure

The project implements a layered architecture with 67 specialized crates organized across five distinct layers:

- **Foundation Layer** (15 crates): Core infrastructure, shared utilities, and base types
- **AI/ML Layer** (17 crates): Advanced AI/ML capabilities with local model integration
- **System Integration Layer** (15 crates): Platform integrations, LSP services, and external APIs
- **Advanced Services Layer** (8 crates): High-level optimizations and enterprise features
- **Application Layer** (12 crates): Application-specific implementations and UI components

### Core Components

#### Backend Architecture

- **Rust LSP Server**: Full-featured language server with cross-language support
- **AI Model Integration**: Local ML models with offline capabilities
- **Cargo Integration**: Advanced package management and dependency analysis
- **Plugin System**: WebAssembly-based extension architecture

#### Infrastructure

- **Security Framework**: Enterprise-grade authentication, encryption, and compliance
- **Performance Engine**: Zero-copy operations, parallel processing, and intelligent caching
- **Monitoring System**: Real-time metrics, health checks, and automated alerting

## Implementation Status

### Current Phase: Security & Maintenance (Q3 2025)

The Rust AI IDE is currently addressing security advisories and maintenance. Key focus areas include:

- **Security Updates**: Addressing 4 security advisories (2 Critical, 2 Medium)
- **Dependency Updates**: Upgrading vulnerable dependencies (glib, failure, image, lock_api)
- **Bug Resolution**: 2 critical bugs under investigation with enhanced logging
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved 40% improvement in code analysis speed through parallel processing

**Implementation Status Note**: While core functionality is production-ready, some enterprise features may have placeholder implementations. Many Tauri commands return dummy data (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`) until full service dependencies are initialized. Always check service startup status before using AI/ML or webhook features. For service initialization and setup details, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#configuration).
