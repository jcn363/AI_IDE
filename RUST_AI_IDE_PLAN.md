# Rust AI IDE - Development Roadmap

## Overview

This document serves as the technical roadmap for the Rust AI IDE project, focusing on architecture, implementation details, and development milestones. It provides comprehensive guidance for contributors, outlining the modular workspace structure, completed implementations, and future development phases.

> **Version**: 3.2.0-release
> **Status**: **🔧 Maintenance Phase - 98% Build Success with 2 Critical Bugs**
> **Architecture**: Modular Workspace (67 crates across 5 layers)
> **Key Technologies**: Rust Nightly, Tauri, LSP Protocol, AI/ML Models

## Architecture Overview

### Modular Workspace Structure

The project implements a layered architecture with 67 specialized crates organized across five distinct layers:

- **Foundation Layer** (15 crates): Core infrastructure, shared utilities, and base types
- **AI/ML Layer** (17 crates): Advanced AI/ML capabilities with local model integration
- **System Integration Layer** (15 crates): Platform integrations, LSP services, and external APIs
- **Advanced Services Layer** (8 crates): High-level optimizations and enterprise features
- **Application Layer** (12 crates): Application-specific implementations and UI components

### Core Components

#### Backend Architecture

- **Rust LSP Server**: Full-featured language server with cross-language support
- **AI Model Integration**: Local ML models with offline capabilities
- **Cargo Integration**: Advanced package management and dependency analysis
- **Plugin System**: WebAssembly-based extension architecture

#### Infrastructure

- **Security Framework**: Enterprise-grade authentication, encryption, and compliance
- **Performance Engine**: Zero-copy operations, parallel processing, and intelligent caching
- **Monitoring System**: Real-time metrics, health checks, and automated alerting

## Implementation Status

### Current Phase: Maintenance & Enhancement

The Rust AI IDE has entered a maintenance phase following the initial production deployment. Key focus areas include:

- **Bug Resolution**: Addressing the 2 critical bugs with automated rollback mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous monitoring and tuning based on real-world usage
- **Security Patching**: Regular updates to address emerging vulnerabilities
- **Feature Completeness**: Implementing placeholder features and improving service initialization

**Implementation Status Note**: While core functionality is production-ready, some enterprise features may have placeholder implementations. Many Tauri commands return dummy data (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`) until full service dependencies are initialized. Always check service startup status before using AI/ML or webhook features. For service initialization and setup details, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#configuration).
