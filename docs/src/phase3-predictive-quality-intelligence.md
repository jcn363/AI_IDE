// Core predictive quality intelligence engine
pub struct PredictiveQualityEngine {
    config: PredictiveConfig,
    vulnerability_predictor: VulnerabilityPredictor,
    performance_forecaster: PerformanceForecaster,
    health_scorer: HealthScorer,
    recommendation_engine: RecommendationEngine,
}
```

## Core Features

### 1. Vulnerability Prediction

The system predicts security vulnerabilities before they become critical:

```rust
// Example: Predicting memory safety vulnerabilities
let predictor = VulnerabilityPredictor::new();
let vulnerabilities = predictor.predict_vulnerabilities(project_path, historical_data).await?;

// Sample output:
// - Injection vulnerability (0.85 confidence, High risk)
//   * Location: src/db.rs:42-48
//   * Timeline: Within Month
//   * Recommendations: [Use prepared statements, Input validation]
```

**Supported Vulnerability Types:**
- âœ… Injection attacks
- âœ… Memory safety issues
- âœ… Cryptographic weaknesses
- âœ… Authentication bypasses
- âœ… Authorization issues
- âœ… Data leakage risks
- âœ… Race conditions
- âœ… Denial-of-service vulnerabilities

### 2. Performance Forecasting

Predicts performance bottlenecks before they impact users:

```rust
// Example: Forecasting CPU bottlenecks
let forecaster = PerformanceForecaster::new();
let bottlenecks = forecaster.forecast_bottlenecks(project_path, historical_data).await?;

// Sample output:
// - CPU Bottleneck (0.92 confidence, Critical severity)
//   * Impact: 35% performance degradation at 100+ users
//   * Mitigation: 12 hours effort
//   * Recommendations: [Parallel processing, Algorithm optimization]
```

**Performance Metrics Tracked:**
- CPU utilization patterns
- Memory allocation efficiency
- I/O operation scalability
- Concurrency contention analysis

### 3. Health Scoring

Comprehensive code health assessment with industry benchmarks:

```rust
// Example: Complete health assessment
let scorer = HealthScorer::new();
let health_scores = scorer.score_project_health(project_path).await?;

// Sample output:
// - Maintainability: 0.78 (Good) - 15% improvement needed
// - Technical Debt: 0.65 (Fair) - $12,500 remediation cost
// - Test Coverage: 0.71 (Fair) - 29% gap to industry average
// - Documentation: 0.82 (Good) - 85% API documentation coverage
```

**Health Dimensions:**
- Maintainability Index (0-171)
- Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis
- Code Duplication Detection
- Technical Debt Quantification
- Industry Benchmarking
- Trend Analysis

### 4. Maintenance Recommendations

Automated, prioritized maintenance suggestions:

```rust
// Example: Generating smart recommendations
let engine = RecommendationEngine::new();
let recommendations = engine.generate_recommendations(&vulnerabilities, &bottlenecks, &health_scores).await?;

// Sample prioritized recommendations:
// 1. [CRITICAL] Address SQL Injection Vulnerability (12 hours, High risk reduction)
// 2. [HIGH] Implement Parallel Processing (20 hours, Performance boost)
// 3. [MEDIUM] Refactor Complex Functions (16 hours, Maintainability improvement)
// 4. [LOW] Update Dependencies (4 hours, Security enhancement)
```
