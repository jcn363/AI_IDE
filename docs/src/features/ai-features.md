# AI-Powered Features

## Intelligent Code Completion

Context-aware suggestions that understand your entire project structure and coding patterns.

### Usage

```rust
// Type and press Ctrl+Space for suggestions
let x = vec![1, 2, 3];
x.iter().map(|i| i * 2).collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

## Automated Refactoring

Safe code restructuring with AI validation and preview capabilities.

### Available Refactorings
- Extract function/method
- Inline variable
- Rename symbol (project-wide)
- Convert between async/sync

## Code Generation

Generate implementations from natural language descriptions.

### Example

```rust
// Type: "Create a function that calculates factorial"
// AI generates:
fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 | 1 => 1,
        _ => n * factorial(n - 1),
    }
}
```

## Performance Analysis
