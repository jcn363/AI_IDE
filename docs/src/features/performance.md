# Performance Optimization

## Overview

This document covers performance optimization techniques and features in Rust AI IDE.

## Performance Features

### Code Analysis
- Incremental compilation
- Parallel dependency resolution
- Caching of analysis results

### Memory Management
- Memory usage optimization
- Leak detection
- Garbage collection tuning

### UI/UX Performance
- Virtual scrolling for large files
- Lazy loading of UI components
- Responsive design optimizations

## Configuration

Performance settings can be adjusted in `config/performance.toml`:

```toml
[compilation]
incremental = true
parallel = true

[memory]
max_heap_size = "4G"
cache_size = "2G"

[ui]
use_hardware_acceleration = true
animation_fps = 60
```

## Best Practices

1. Enable incremental compilation for faster builds
2. Monitor memory usage and adjust heap size as needed
3. Use the latest version of Rust and dependencies
4. Profile regularly to identify bottlenecks

## Troubleshooting

Common performance issues and solutions:

- **Slow compilation**: Enable incremental compilation
- **High memory usage**: Increase heap size or optimize code
- **UI lag**: Disable animations or reduce workspace size
