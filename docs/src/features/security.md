# Security Features

## Overview

Rust AI IDE includes several security features to protect your code and development environment.

## Key Security Features

### Code Analysis
- Static code analysis to detect security vulnerabilities
- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Secrets detection in code and configuration

### Authentication & Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure credential storage
- Audit logging for all sensitive operations

## Configuration

Security settings can be configured in `config/security.toml`:

```toml
[authentication]
enable_mfa = true
session_timeout = 3600

[encryption]
key_rotation_days = 90

[audit]
enable_logging = true
retention_days = 365
```

## Best Practices

1. Always enable MFA for production environments
2. Regularly rotate encryption keys
3. Review audit logs periodically
4. Keep dependencies up to date
5. Follow the principle of least privilege

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Authentication failures**: Check system time synchronization
- **Permission denied**: Verify user roles and permissions
- **TLS errors**: Ensure certificates are valid and trusted

## Reporting Security Issues

Please report security vulnerabilities to security@example.com.
