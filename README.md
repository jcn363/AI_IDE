fn process_data(data: Vec<String>) {
    data.iter().map(|item| {
        // AI suggests: item.to_uppercase()
        // Based on context and project patterns
    })
}
```

**Automated Refactoring with AI Validation**

```rust
// Select code and right-click ‚Üí "AI Refactor"
// Original:
let result = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5].into_iter().filter(|x| x % 2 == 0).collect::<Vec<_>>();

// AI suggests:
let result: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    .into_iter()
    .filter(|x| x % 2 == 0)
    .collect();
```

#### Performance-Optimized Workflows
