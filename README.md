// 4. Enable passwordless login for future sessions
```

#### AI-Powered Development

**Intelligent Code Completion**
```rust
// Type the following and press Ctrl+Space:
fn process_data(data: Vec<String>) {
    data.iter().map(|item| {
        // AI suggests: item.to_uppercase()
        // Based on context and project patterns
    })
}
```

**Automated Refactoring with AI Validation**
```rust
// Select code and right-click → "AI Refactor"
// Original:
let result = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5].into_iter().filter(|x| x % 2 == 0).collect::<Vec<_>>();

// AI suggests:
let result: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    .into_iter()
    .filter(|x| x % 2 == 0)
    .collect();
```

#### Performance-Optimized Workflows

**Lazy Loading Demonstration**
```bash
# First launch: ~300ms startup (core only)
# After AI features requested: Services load in background
# Memory usage stays under 1.8GB for 1M+ LOC workspaces
```

**Work-Stealing Schedulers**
```rust
// Automatic optimization - no user configuration needed
// CPU cores are utilized efficiently across:
// - LSP analysis
// - AI model inference
// - File watching
// - Background compilation
```
